# [eleventeen v8](https://github.com/rdela/eleventeen)

## WARNING: Here Be Canaries üê•

This starter has advanced ahead of its upstream source, [eleventy-base-blog v8](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), to boldy embrace [Eleventy v3.0](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/canary-eleventy-v3/#how-to-require(@11ty/eleventy)-in-commonjs) in [PR #8](https://github.com/rdela/eleventeen/pull/8).

eleventy-base-blog describes itself as:

> A starter repository showing how to build a blog with the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site generator (using the [v2.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/)).

In addition to all of base-blog‚Äôs killer features and Eleventy 3‚Äôs bundler-free [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) support, eleventeen sports [MOTHEREFFIN Rainbow mode](https://github.com/rdela/eleventeen/pull/1) powered by [Chromagen](https://github.com/famebot/chromagen) üåàüìì‚ûïüé®üí•

Rejoicing and rainbows aside, eleventeen also makes some more subtle adjustments to eleventy-base-blog. There are various changes in `public/css/index.css`, and in `_includes/postslist.njk`:
 
```njk
<ol reversed class="postlist" style="counter-reset: start-from {{ (postslistCounter or postslist.length) + 1 }}">
```
 
becomes:
 
```njk
<ul reversed class="postlist">
```

The eleventeen name is an homage to the [Daisy Chainsaw album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventeen_(album)) üë©üèª‚Äçüé§üé∂

### Implementation Notes

- `content/about/index.md` is an example of a content page.
- `content/archive/` has the blog posts but really they can live in any directory, in eleventy-base-blog they are in [`content/blog/`](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/tree/main/content/blog). They only need the `posts` tag to be included in the blog posts [collection](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/), see `content/archive/archive.11tydata.js`.
- Use the `eleventyNavigation` key (via the [Eleventy Navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/)) in your front matter to add a template to the top level site navigation. This is in use on `content/index.njk` and `content/about/index.md`.
- Content can be in _any template format_ (blog posts needn‚Äôt exclusively be markdown, for example). Configure your project‚Äôs supported templates in `eleventy.config.js` -> `templateFormats`.
- The `public` folder in your input directory will be copied to the output folder (via `addPassthroughCopy` in the `eleventy.config.js` file). This means `./public/css/*` will live at `./_site/css/*` after your build completes.
- Provides two content feeds:
	- `content/feed/feed.njk`
	- `content/feed/json.njk`
- This project uses three [Eleventy Layouts](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/layouts/):
	- `_includes/layouts/base.njk`: the top level HTML structure
	- `_includes/layouts/home.njk`: the home page template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
	- `_includes/layouts/post.njk`: the blog post template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
- `_includes/postslist.njk` is a Nunjucks include and is a reusable component used to display a list of all the posts. `content/index.njk` has an example of how to use it.

#### Content Security Policy

If your site enforces a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (as public-facing sites should), you should pick one:

1. In `base.njk`, remove `<style>{% getBundle "css" %}</style>` and uncomment `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% getBundleFileUrl "css" %}">`
2. Configure the server with the CSP directive `style-src: 'unsafe-inline'` (less secure).
